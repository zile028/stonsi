            forward to it as much as we were, but the health and safety of everyone has to take priority. We
            will all get through this together — and we’ll see you very soon” - <span>Mick, Keith, Charlie and

            <p> The latest, Blue B Lonesome, was recorded in just three days, with little planning or overthinking.
                Granted, it's a covers album filled with the type of blues songs the band cut its teeth on more than 50
                years ago, but that doesn't take away from its spitfire appeal. The Stones haven't made an album this
                virile in decades.</p>
            <p>It certainly helps that the core quartet (along with some help from friends like Eric Clapton and Chuck
                Leavell) sounds like its off the clock. You have to go all the way back to the mid-'60s for Stones
                performances this loose and friendly. From the opening blare of "Just Your Fool," featuring the first of
                several howling harmonica solos by Mick Jagger, to the closing cover of Willie Dixon's classic "I Can't
                Quit You Baby," Blue B Lonesome is the sound of a legendary band making the most of its autumn years by
                revisiting its past.</p>
